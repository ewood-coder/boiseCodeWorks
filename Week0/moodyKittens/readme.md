> Everyone on the internet should have a experience the joys of owning a cat!

## Goals

Students that successfully build this application and meet all of the requirements will recieve a `$500 discount` from their tuition when they join the CodeWorks Immersive Fullstack course.

## The Setup

The basic design and layout for this app has been mocked out and the names of the JavaScript functions have all been created. As the developer you will need to work across HTML, CSS and JavaScript to complete the requirements. In the code you will see several comments intended to be used as help and guidelines on what needs to be accomplished. Once you have achieved the requirements of the app use GitHub to host the page live.
